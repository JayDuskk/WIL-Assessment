  - CHAPTER 1 - Meeting
  - "The scene is set in the lobby of the university, where people are mingling before
    class starts. It\u2019s the beginning of the trimester and our two protagonists,
    an international student and a First Nations student are just about to meet"
  - "International Student: Um, excuse me? Do you know where (insert class) is? I\u2019m
    new here and I don\u2019t know where the classes are\u2026"
  - "First Nations Student: Oh yeah! I\u2019m in that class as well! It\u2019s on
    the second level, the large class labelled at the end of the hallway (insert
    classroom code). My name\u2019s [NAME], what\u2019s yours?"
  - 'International Student: [INSERT NAME HERE]!'
  - "First Nations Student: I\u2019m so thankful I\u2019ve at least met somebody
    sharing the same class as me, it certainly helps to know somebody!"
  - "International Student: Yeah, it does! I\u2019m new to the country, so I haven\u2019t
    been able to meet a lot of people."
  - 'First Nations Student: Oh nice! Where are you originally from?'
  - 'International Student: [INSERT COUNTRY HERE], moved here about a few months
    ago. How about you? Where are you from?'
  - "First Nations Student: I\u2019m actually a First Nations person! I\u2019m from
    Wiradjuri country."
  - "International Student: Oh, interesting\u2026I have never heard of a \u201CFirst
    Nations person\u201D before, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of that
    country before. "
  - "First Nations Student: Um, well I\u2019m native to Australia! I\u2019m an Aboriginal
    person, but I prefer to call myself a First Nations person. I don\u2019t come
    from a different country - Wiradjuri country is a certain region in Australia
    where my people come from!"
  - "There\u2019s tons of different countries in Australia where different groups
    have different languages and slightly different cultural practices."
  - 'First Nations Student: Hehe, thank you!'
  - "First Nations Student: Um\u2026I\u2019m not really sure how to answer that\u2026"
  - 'First Nations Student: Anyways, class is about to start - should we start heading
    up?'
  - CHAPTER 2 - Class
  - The class is just starting to pour into the room when these two characters arrive.
    As people find their seats and get ready for class, the lecturer arrives and
    starts setting up for his lecture.
  - 'Our two protags manage to find a free table, where they sit together. The lecturer
    starts the class with an introduction to himself and the course. '
  - As he goes through his lecture slides, he mentions the name of a recently deceased
    First Nations artist.
  - "First Nations Student: I\u2026uh\u2026Excuse me [LECTURER], may I step outside
    for a while?"
  - "Lecturer: Yeah, that\u2019s fine. Go ahead."
  - '[FN] quickly leaves the classroom. After five minutes have passed, [IN] follows
    them outside to check up on them out of concern.'
  - '[FN] quickly leaves the classroom. After five minutes have passed, [IN] follows
    them outside to check up on them out of concern.'
  - "International Student: Hey, are you ok? You kinda left in a hurry there\u2026"
  - "First Nations Student: Yeah, I\u2019m ok. Is the lecturer still talking about
    uh\u2026the First Nations Artist?"
  - "International Student: Uh, no. He moved on from that, he\u2019s talking about
    design principles now. Is everything ok?"
  - "First Nations Student: Yeah\u2026that artist passed away recently, and I\u2019m
    in the process of \u201Csorry business\u201D, we try to avoid the names of people
    who\u2019ve died recently. "
  - "First Nations Student: It\u2019s ok, I just didn\u2019t expect the artist to
    be in the lecture today. Thanks for checking up on me, that was really kind of
    you to do."
  - "First Nations Student: Wow, that\u2019s just\u2026whatever\u2026"
  - '[IN] goes back to class and resumes taking notes. After a few minutes, [FN]
    comes back and sits down next [IN], continuing on with the rest of the lesson. '
  - After class ends, [IN]notices that [FN] has stayed back to speak to the teacher.
