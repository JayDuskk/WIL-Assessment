  - "Ada: Um, excuse me? Do you know where the class for Design Principles is? I\u2019m
    new here and I don\u2019t know where the classes are\u2026"
  - "Jack: Oh yeah! I\u2019m in that class as well! It\u2019s on the second level,
    the large class labelled at the end of the hallway F2.10. My name\u2019s Jack,
    what\u2019s yours?"
  - 'Ada: Ada!'
  - "Jack: I\u2019m so thankful I\u2019ve at least met somebody sharing the same
    class as me, it certainly helps to know somebody!"
  - "Ada: Yeah, it does! I\u2019m new to the country, so I haven\u2019t been able
    to meet a lot of people."
  - 'Jack: Oh nice! Where are you originally from?'
  - 'Ada: Germany, I moved here about a few months ago. How about you? Where are
    you from?'
  - "Jack: I\u2019m actually a First Nations person! I\u2019m from Wiradjuri country."
  - "Ada: Oh, interesting\u2026I have never heard of a \u201CFirst Nations person\u201D
    before, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of that country before. "
  - "Jack: Um, well I\u2019m native to Australia! I\u2019m an Aboriginal person,
    but I prefer to call myself a First Nations person. I don\u2019t come from a
    different country - Wiradjuri country is a certain region in Australia where
    my people come from!"
  - There are tons of separate mobs in Australia where different clans have different
    dialects and slightly different cultural practices.
  - 'Jack: Hehe, thank you!'
  - "Um\u2026Well\u2026There\u2019s no real way to look Australian, Australia\u2019s
    made up of a plethora of different cultures. There isn\u2019t a standard cut-and-dry
    image of an average Aussie."
